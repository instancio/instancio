 * The field {@code T value} should be populated when generating instances

 * Populating this field for subclasses requires traversing the inheritance
 * hierarchy in order to resolve the type. For this reason, we have
 * {@code GenderEnumHolder} classes 1, 2, and 3, in order to ensure this works
 * not only for the direct child {@code GenderEnumHolder1}, but also for
 * deeper descendants (2 and 3).
