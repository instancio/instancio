# Building From Sources

Instancio is packaged as a [multi-release JAR](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/238).
It can be used with Java 8 or higher.
Building Instancio from sources requires JDK 17 or higher:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/instancio/instancio.git
cd instancio
mvn verify
```

# Building the Website

This site is built using <a href="https://www.mkdocs.org">MkDocs</a>
and <a href="https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material">MkDocs Material</a> theme.
Home page theme overrides are from <a href="https://sdk.up42.com">UP42</a>.

To build the site, you will need the following Python packages:

```sh
pip install mkdocs \
    mkdocs-material \
    mkdocs-macros-plugin \
    mkdocs-autolinks-plugin
```

To run the site locally: `cd website && mkdocs serve`. To generate static HTML: `mkdocs build`.
